# What is autism?

## What is autsim?
Autism is a lifelong condition that changes the way the brain develops and works.

## What causes autism?
Most experts think that there isn't one cause of autism, and sometimes it can be due to genetics. Autism starts before a child is born, even if it takes a few years to be visible. **Autism is NOT caused by bad parenting, vaccines, infections, diet or trauma.**

## Is there a cure?
No, there is no cure, an there is no need for a cure. Any treatment that pretends to be a cure is not honest.

## Who can be autistic?
People of any gender, any skin colour, any culture, any origin, any religion can be autistic.

## Is it possible to "grow out" of autism?
No, autistic people's experiences and abilities change during their life, like everybody, but they will always be autistic. Autism is an important part of their identity.

## What can autistic people do?
Autistic people can do great things, just like non-autistic people. They might just do some things differently.
